Steps on how I created the code:
1. First, I created each function without its content first to see the totality.
2. For the checkPass function, I did the conditions one by one to see if it works. I also created variables to check whether the conditions are met or not.
3. For the reversePass function, I iterated the character of the strings backwards and store it in a variable.
4. For the storePass function, if the password is valid, I store the name and the reverse password in an object.

Key takeaways:
1. It is important to remember how to use loops for iteration in strings.
2. Also, it is vital to know the string functions so that you can make the exercise.
